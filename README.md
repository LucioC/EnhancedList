EnhancedList
=============================

An Android ListView with enhanced functionality (e.g. Swipe To Dismiss and Undo)

The documentation can be found in the wiki: https://github.com/timroes/EnhancedListView/wiki

Development Updates
------------------

- A complete refactoring was made from the old timroes project to split classes into different files, and extract some common behaviors and interfaces
- So far, the old ListView version still exist and should work the same
- A first EnhancedRecyclerListView draft is under review

Development TODO list
------------------

- Review RecyclerView use. Is it being used correctly? Using it's full potential?
- Add automated tests
